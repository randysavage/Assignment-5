Question #4: the flying fox (ptoperus) is most closely related to: synconyteris australis, dobsonio viridis, cynopteus sphinx, rousettus leschenaultii, epomophorous wahlbergi 
Question #5: With quickly spreading dieases like COVID-19, we can use phylogeny to understand different strains of the virus and its mutations. Comparing the genome sequences of viruses can help to find vaccines, proper treatment, and potential isolation procedures to fight diease spread.
